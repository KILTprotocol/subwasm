NOTE: By default, the ID for the Parachain pallet is expected to be `0x01` and the call ID for `authorize_upgrade` is expected to be `0x03`.
This default behavior can be overriden by setting the `PARACHAIN_PALLET_ID` to the ID of your parachain pallet and the `AUTHORIZE_UPGRADE_PREFIX` to the ID of your choice.
