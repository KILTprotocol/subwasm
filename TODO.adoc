== TODOS:

- [ ] byte arrays should be smartly displayed: Short ones can be shown as such but long ones should be encoded to hex and truncated. The user can still use the json output to get the full data
- [ ] Show extrinsics: see `// TODO: deal with extrinsic as well`

- [x] load wasm file
- [x] add ws support (= switch to substrate-api-client ?)
- [x] compute section hashes
- [ ] show sections summary as diff
- [ ] fix subwasm meta | head => piping fails
- [ ] add --chain to meta command
The main command loads ONE wasm and analyses it (meta + version).
- [ ] Add option to SHOW a runtime as a ReducedRuntime
- [ ] hunt down expects and unwrap
- [ ] remove those --chain-a --chain-b and use ONE enum that can handle 3 sources: file / url / alias
- [ ] integrate with subrpc
